												<h3>Leadership</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality, and it is a leader’s responsibility to develop a vision for the people and institutions they direct. They also need to effectively communicate their priorities to others and inspire them to commit to those goals as well. Leadership does not depend on one’s title. Leaders can emerge at any level if they can motivate those with whom they collaborate to strive toward a common goal.</p>
											<p>Successful leaders are often credited with having high social intelligence, the ability to embrace change, inner resources such as self-awareness and self-mastery, and above all, the capacity to focus on the things that truly merit their attention. These are desirable skills for everyone else, too.</p>
											<p>Effective leaders likely share some key personality traits, including sociability, ambition, and curiosity—and these traits may be more relevant to the role than intelligence. Genetics appear to influence leadership ability, due to inherited personality traits, but environmental factors such as education and opportunity play a significant role as well.</p>

												<h3>Cyber Strategy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A cybersecurity strategy is a high-level plan for how organization will secure its assets & protect business. Obviously, because technology and cyber threats are evolving & can change unpredictably, almost certainly cyber strategy have to update & evolve. A cybersecurity strategy isn't meant to be perfect; it's a strongly educated guess as to what should be do. </p>
											<p>The intended outcome of developing and implementing a cybersecurity strategy is that assets, crown Jewels and everything important for business to function are better secured. This generally involves a shift from a reactive to proactive security approach, where more focused is given on preventing cyber attacks and incidents than reacting to them after the fact. But a solid cybersecurity strategy will also better prepare organization to respond to those incidents that do occur. By preventing minor incidents from becoming major ones, organization can preserve its reputation and reduce harm to the organization and its employees, customers, partners and others.</p>

												<h3>Risk and Governance</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Risk governance refers to the institutions, rules conventions, processes and mechanisms by which decisions about risks are taken and implemented. It can be both normative and positive, because it analyses and formulates risk management strategies to avoid and/or reduce the human and economic costs caused by disasters.</p>
											<p>Risk governance goes beyond traditional risk analysis to include the involvement and participation of various stakeholders as well as considerations of the broader legal, political, economic and social contexts in which a risk is evaluated and managed. </p>

												<h3>Zero Trust Security</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Today, organizations need a new security model that more effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located. This is the core of Zero Trust.</p>
											<p>Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, Zero Trust teaches us to “never trust, always verify.”</p>

												<h3>Internet of Things</h3>
											</header>
											<p>IoT is all about connecting things using LPWAN connectivity to create smart connected world using new technology over Wide Area Network.</p>
											<p>Low-power WAN (LPWAN) is a wireless wide area network technology that interconnects low-bandwidth, battery-powered devices with low bit rates over long ranges. LPWANs operate at a lower cost with greater power efficiency than traditional mobile networks.</p>
											<p>True business value of the IoT lies in Data Analytics (DA), a process used to examine big and small data sets with varying data properties to extract meaningful conclusions which are usually in the form of trends, patterns, and statistics that aid business organizations in effective decision-making processes. </p>

												<h3>Multicloud Strategy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Multi-cloud / Hybrid architecture empowers organizations to distribute their workloads across multiple cloud environments along with on-prem infrastructure so they can get the biggest bang for their buck while mitigating risks associated with individual cloud environments.</p>
											<p>All cloud services are prone to failure. Although technically correct, this argument is widely used by industry laggards as a deterrent to cloud adoption. And even if practical examples of cloud outages support this argument, the cloud industry already offers promising solutions to address these concerns.</p>
											<p>For progressive organizations that want to fly cloud-ward without placing all their eggs in the same basket, they can do just that: leverage a multi-cloud environment.  This value proposition alone justifies widespread growth and adoption of multi-cloud infrastructure solutions in the future.
